# Weather-Data-Collector
Built a backend application that automatically fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API every minute using APScheduler, stores it in MongoDB, and provides the latest weather info via a FastAPI REST endpoint. Implemented API integration, background task automation, and clean JSON responses. .
